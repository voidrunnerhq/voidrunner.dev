PLACEHOLDER: VoidRunner Favicon ICO (16x16, 32x32, 48x48px)
This should be replaced with a proper .ico file containing multiple sizes based on the VoidRunner icon:

Design: Blue rounded rectangle with white neural network pattern and purple accent
- 16x16px: Simplified version with just the blue square and minimal details
- 32x32px: Include neural network dots and connections
- 48x48px: Full detail version matching the SVG favicon

To generate: Use favicon.svg as source and convert using:
- Online ICO generators (favicon.io, realfavicongenerator.net)
- Design tools (Figma, Sketch, Photoshop)
- Command line tools (ImageMagick, etc.)
